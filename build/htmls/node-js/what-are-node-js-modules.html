    <h2>What are Modules?</h2>
    <p>
        In Node.js, a module is a self-contained piece of code that encapsulates related functionality. Modules can be
        easily imported and exported using the `require()` and `module.exports` functions, respectively. This allows
        developers to write modular code that is easy to maintain, test, and reuse across different parts of an
        application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js comes with a number of built-in modules, such as the `fs` (file system) module and the `http` module,
        that provide core functionality for interacting with the file system and handling HTTP requests, respectively.
        In addition, Node.js has a vast library of third-party modules that can be installed using the `npm` (Node
        Package Manager) tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modules can be created by simply writing a JavaScript file that exports one or more functions or objects. These
        functions or objects can then be imported into other parts of the application using the `require()` function. In
        this way, modules provide a powerful tool for organizing and structuring code in a way that is easy to maintain
        and reuse.

        In this tutorial, we will explore some of the built-in modules provided by Node.js, as well as some popular
        third-party modules that can be used to add additional functionality to your application. By the end of this
        section, you will have a solid understanding of how modules work in Node.js and how they can be used to build
        modular and maintainable code.
