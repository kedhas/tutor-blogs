    <h2>Node.js vs Traditional Server-Side Programming</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js differs from traditional server-side programming in several ways. One of the main differences is that
        Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple concurrent requests with minimal
        overhead. This is in contrast to traditional server-side languages like PHP and Ruby, which typically use a
        blocking I/O model that can slow down performance as the number of requests increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key difference is that Node.js is built on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine, which provides fast
        and efficient performance by compiling JavaScript code directly to machine code. This can be faster than
        traditional server-side languages, which often use interpreters or virtual machines to execute code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js also provides a streamlined development experience by using the same language, JavaScript, on both the
        client and server sides of an application. This makes it easier to share code and maintain consistency across
        the entire application stack. In addition, Node.js has a rich library of modules and tools that can make it
        faster and easier to build complex applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        While traditional server-side programming has its own strengths, Node.js offers a modern, flexible, and
        efficient alternative that can be a great choice for building real-time web applications that require high
        scalability and efficient performance. Whether you're an experienced server-side developer or just getting
        started, Node.js can provide a powerful and flexible toolset for building the web applications of the future.
