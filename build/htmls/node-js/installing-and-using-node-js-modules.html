    <h2>Installing and Using Modules</h2>
    <p>
        In Node.js, modules can be easily installed and managed using the `npm` (Node Package Manager) tool. `npm`
        allows developers to search for, install, and update modules from a central repository, as well as publish their
        own modules for others to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        To install a module, you simply need to run the `npm install` command followed by the name of the module. For
        example, to install the `express` module, you would run `npm install express`. This will download and install
        the `express` module and all its dependencies in a folder called `node_modules`.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a module is installed, it can be used in your code by importing it using the `require()` function. For
        example, to use the `express` module in your code, you would add the following line at the top of your file:
        `const express = require('express')`. This will import the `express` module and make its functionality available
        in your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the `npm` repository, there are many other places where you can find Node.js modules, such as
        GitHub and other code repositories. These modules can be installed in the same way as modules from the `npm`
        repository, using the `npm install` command followed by the path or URL to the module.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, we will explore how to install and use modules from both the `npm` repository and other
        sources. We will also cover some best practices for managing modules and dependencies in your Node.js
        applications. By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to install and use modules
        in Node.js, as well as how to manage dependencies in your applications.
