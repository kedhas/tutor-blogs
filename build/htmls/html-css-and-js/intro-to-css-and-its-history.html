  <h1>Introduction to CSS and its History</h1>
  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to add style, layout, and formatting to web documents. It
    was created to separate content from presentation, allowing web developers to create dynamic and responsive websites
    without compromising the structure and semantics of the web content.</p>
  <p>The development of CSS began in 1994, when the web was in its infancy and HTML was the primary language used to
    create web pages. Before CSS, web developers had to use HTML to format and style web pages, which made it difficult
    to change the design of a web page without also changing its content.</p>
  <p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994, while he was working at CERN (the European Organization for
    Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. Lie's vision was to create a separate style sheet that could be attached to an
    HTML document to describe how the document should be presented. By separating content from presentation, developers
    could create more efficient and flexible web pages that could be easily updated and maintained.</p>
  <p>The first version of CSS, CSS1, was released in 1996 and included basic styling capabilities such as font and color
    properties. CSS2 followed in 1998, adding support for more advanced layout and formatting features such as
    positioning, borders, and backgrounds. CSS3 was introduced in 1999 and included even more advanced features such as
    animations, transformations, and gradients.</p>
  <p>Today, CSS is an essential tool for web development, and new versions of CSS are continually being developed to
    support the latest web technologies and design trends.</p>
