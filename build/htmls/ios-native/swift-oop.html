    <h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
    <p>Swift is an object-oriented language, which means that it is designed to work with objects, which are instances
        of classes. Here are some of the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in Swift:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Classes are blueprints for objects. They define the properties and methods that
            objects of that class will have.</li>
        <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Objects are instances of classes. They have their own set of values for the
            properties defined in the class.</li>
        <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Properties are the characteristics of an object, such as its color, size, or
            name.</li>
        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Methods are the actions that an object can perform, such as moving, rotating, or
            animating.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Inheritance is the ability to create new classes based on existing classes.
            This allows you to reuse code and create more specialized classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This allows
            you to write code that works with objects of different types.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of a simple class in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            class Shape {
                var color: String
                var name: String

                init(color: String, name: String) {
                    self.color = color
                    self.name = name
                }

                func describe() {
                    print("I am a \(color) \(name)")
                }
            }

            // Create an object of the Shape class
            let shape = Shape(color: "red", name: "square")

            // Call the describe() method on the object
            shape.describe()
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Here's an example of a subclass that inherits from the Shape class:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            class Circle: Shape {
                var radius: Double

                init(color: String, name: String, radius: Double) {
                    self.radius = radius
                    super.init(color: color, name: name)
                }

                override func describe() {
                    print("I am a \(color) circle with radius \(radius)")
                }
            }

            // Create an object of the Circle class
            let circle = Circle(color: "blue", name: "circle", radius: 2.0)

            // Call the describe() method on the object
            circle.describe()
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Here's an example of how to use polymorphism in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            // Create an array of Shape objects
            var shapes: [Shape] = []
            shapes.append(Shape(color: "red", name: "square"))
            shapes.append(Circle(color: "green", name: "circle", radius: 3.0))

            // Call the describe() method on each object
            for shape in shapes {
                shape.describe()
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
