    <h2>Why develop natively for iOS?</h2>
    <p>Developing native iOS apps offers several advantages over other types of app development, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Better performance:</strong> Native apps are optimized to run on iOS devices, so they are typically
            faster and more responsive than web or hybrid apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Full hardware access:</strong> Native apps have access to all of the hardware features of the
            device, including the camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope, which allows for richer and more interactive
            user experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Native apps offer more control over the user interface and can be
            customized to match the look and feel of the iOS platform. This can result in a more polished and
            professional app that users will love.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline support:</strong> Native apps can be designed to work offline, which means that users can
            continue to use the app even if they are not connected to the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to the latest features:</strong> Native apps can take advantage of the latest features and
            capabilities of the iOS platform, such as augmented reality, Siri, and Apple Pay.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, let's say you want to build a camera app that allows users to take photos and apply filters.
        Developing this app natively for iOS would allow you to access the camera hardware directly and take advantage
        of the powerful graphics capabilities of iOS devices to apply filters in real-time. This would result in a fast
        and responsive app with high-quality visuals and a great user experience.</p>
