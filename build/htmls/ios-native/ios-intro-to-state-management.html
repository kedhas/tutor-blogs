    <h2>Introduction to State Management</h2>
    <p>State management is the process of storing and updating application state in a structured and predictable way. In
        iOS development, state management is crucial for creating complex and dynamic user interfaces.</p>

    <h3>What is Application State?</h3>
    <p>Application state refers to any data that describes the current state of the application. This can include things
        like user preferences, data fetched from a server, the current selection in a list, or any other data that needs
        to be persisted across different parts of the application.</p>

    <h3>Why is State Management Important?</h3>
    <p>Without proper state management, it can be difficult to keep track of changes to the application state, leading
        to bugs and unexpected behavior. By using a consistent and structured approach to state management, you can
        ensure that your application remains predictable and maintainable, even as it grows in complexity.</p>

    <h3>Common State Management Techniques</h3>
    <p>There are several common techniques for managing application state in iOS development, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local State:</strong> Local state is state that is managed within a single view or view controller.
            This can be useful for managing simple UI state, such as the text of a label or the state of a switch.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared State:</strong> Shared state is state that is managed across multiple views or view
            controllers. This can be useful for managing complex state that needs to be shared across the application,
            such as the current user or the data in a shopping cart.</li>
        <li><strong>Global State:</strong> Global state is state that is managed across the entire application. This can
            be useful for managing data that needs to be accessed from multiple parts of the application, such as a
            user's authentication token or the app's theme.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: Local State in Swift</h3>
    <p>Here's an example of using local state to manage a simple UI element in Swift:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">
    class MyViewController: UIViewController {
        var isOn: Bool = false
        
        @IBOutlet weak var toggleSwitch: UISwitch!
        
        @IBAction func toggleSwitchValueChanged(_ sender: UISwitch) {
            isOn = sender.isOn
        }
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we're using local state to manage the value of a `UISwitch`. When the user toggles the switch,
        the `toggleSwitchValueChanged` method is called, which updates the `isOn` property to reflect the new value of
        the switch. This allows us to manage simple UI state in a straightforward and predictable way.</p>
