    <h2>Storyboard vs. programmatic UI</h2>
    <p>When developing an iOS app, you have two main options for creating the user interface: using storyboards or
        creating the interface programmatically. Here are some of the pros and cons of each approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storyboards:</strong> Storyboards are visual editors that allow you to design and layout your user
            interface using a drag-and-drop interface. They can be a great way to quickly prototype and iterate on your
            app's design, and they provide a visual representation of your app's navigation flow. However, they can also
            become unwieldy and hard to manage as your app's complexity grows, and they can be difficult to collaborate
            on with other team members.</li>
        <li><strong>Programmatic UI:</strong> Programmatic UI involves writing code to create and configure the user
            interface. This approach can be more time-consuming than using storyboards, but it gives you more control
            over the layout and appearance of your app. It can also be easier to manage and maintain, especially for
            large and complex apps, and it allows for greater collaboration with other developers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of how to create a simple user interface programmatically in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            class MyViewController: UIViewController {

                override func viewDidLoad() {
                    super.viewDidLoad()

                    let label = UILabel()
                    label.text = "Hello, world!"
                    label.textAlignment = .center
                    label.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 24)

                    let button = UIButton()
                    button.setTitle("Click me", for: .normal)
                    button.setTitleColor(.blue, for: .normal)

                    let stackView = UIStackView(arrangedSubviews: [label, button])
                    stackView.axis = .vertical
                    stackView.spacing = 16

                    view.addSubview(stackView)
                    stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
                    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
                        stackView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
                        stackView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)
                    ])
                }
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This code creates a simple view controller with a label and a button, and uses a stack view to arrange them
        vertically in the center of the screen. Note that this is just one example of how to create a programmatic user
        interface; there are many different approaches and techniques you can use, depending on the needs of your app.

    <h2>Stacks</h2>
    <p>In SwiftUI, <code>ZStack</code>, <code>HStack</code>, and <code>VStack</code> are container views that allow you
        to arrange other views in a specific layout. Here's an overview of each:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>ZStack</code>: A <code>ZStack</code> arranges its child views in a stack, with each view positioned on
            top of the one below it. You can adjust the position of each view using the <code>alignment</code>
            parameter, which determines how the views are aligned within the stack.</li>
        <pre>
                <code>
                    ZStack(alignment: .center) {
                        Circle()
                            .fill(Color.red)
                            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                        Text("Hello, world!")
                            .font(.headline)
                    }                    
                </code>
            </pre>
        <li><code>HStack</code>: An <code>HStack</code> arranges its child views in a horizontal line, with each view
            next to the one before it. You can adjust the spacing between the views using the <code>spacing</code>
            parameter, and the alignment of the views using the <code>alignment</code> parameter.</li>
        <pre>
                <code>
                    HStack(spacing: 20) {
                        Image(systemName: "person.fill")
                            .font(.largeTitle)
                        Text("John Smith")
                            .font(.headline)
                    }                                   
                </code>
            </pre>
        <li><code>VStack</code>: A <code>VStack</code> arranges its child views in a vertical line, with each view below
            the one before it. You can adjust the spacing between the views using the <code>spacing</code> parameter,
            and the alignment of the views using the <code>alignment</code> parameter.</li>
        <pre>
                <code>
                    VStack(spacing: 10) {
                        Text("First item")
                        Text("Second item")
                        Text("Third item")
                    }                         
                </code>
            </pre>
    </ul>
    <p>By using <code>ZStack</code>, <code>HStack</code>, and <code>VStack</code>, you can create complex layouts in
        your SwiftUI views with just a few lines of code. These views are also flexible and can adjust to changes in the
        size of the screen or the content they contain.</p>
