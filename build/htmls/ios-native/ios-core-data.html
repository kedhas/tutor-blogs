    <p>Core Data is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to store data in their applications. It
        provides a way to manage data using object graphs and can handle complex data structures and relationships
        between objects. Core Data can be used with a variety of data stores, including SQLite and XML.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of how you might use Core Data to store and retrieve data:</p>
    <pre><code>import CoreData
  
    let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
    let context = appDelegate.persistentContainer.viewContext
  
    // Create a new entity
    let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: "Person", in: context)!
    let person = NSManagedObject(entity: entity, insertInto: context)
  
    // Set the values for the entity
    person.setValue("John", forKey: "name")
    person.setValue(30, forKey: "age")
  
    // Save the entity to the data store
    do {
        try context.save()
    } catch let error as NSError {
        print("Could not save. \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
    }
  
    // Fetch the data from the data store
    let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest&lt;NSManagedObject&gt;(entityName: "Person")
  
    do {
        let people = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
        for person in people {
            let name = person.value(forKey: "name") as! String
            let age = person.value(forKey: "age") as! Int
            print("Name: \(name), Age: \(age)")
        }
    } catch let error as NSError {
        print("Could not fetch. \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we use Core Data to store information about people. We create a new entity called "Person" and
        set its name and age values. We then save the entity to the data store using the managed object context.</p>
    <p>To retrieve the data, we use a fetch request to get all the "Person" entities from the data store. We then
        iterate through the results and print out the name and age values for each person.</p>
    <p>Core Data is a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to store and manage data in your Swift
        applications. With its support for object graphs and complex data relationships, it is a great choice for many
        types of applications.</p>
