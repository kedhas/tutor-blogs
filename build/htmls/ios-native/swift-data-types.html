    <h2>Data types</h2>
    <p>Swift is a statically-typed language, which means that every variable must be declared with a specific data type.
        Here are some of the basic data types in Swift:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Int:</strong> A whole number, such as 42 or -17.</li>
        <li><strong>Double:</strong> A floating-point number with more precision than Float, such as 3.14159 or -0.0001.
        </li>
        <li><strong>String:</strong> A sequence of characters, such as "Hello, world!" or "42".</li>
        <li><strong>Bool:</strong> A Boolean value that is either true or false.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of how to declare and assign values to variables in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            // Declare a variable of type Int
            var score: Int

            // Assign a value to the variable
            score = 42

            // Declare and assign a value to a variable in one line
            var message: String = "Hello, world!"
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Swift also supports type inference, which means that the compiler can automatically deduce the data type based on
        the initial value of the variable. For example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            // Swift infers that this variable is of type Double
            var pi = 3.14159
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Variables in Swift can be declared as either mutable (var) or immutable (let). Immutable variables are declared
        with the let keyword and cannot be changed once they are assigned a value. Mutable variables are declared with
        the var keyword and can be changed at any time.</p>

    <h2>Collection objects in Swift</h2>
    <p>Collection objects are a key part of many iOS apps, and Swift provides several different types of collections
        that you can use, depending on your needs. Here's an overview of some of the most common collection types:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Array:</strong> An array is an ordered collection of values of the same type. You can add,
            remove, and access elements in an array using subscript syntax, and you can iterate over the elements of
            an array using a for loop. Here's an example of how to create an array of strings and access its
            elements:</li>
        <pre>
            <code>
                var myArray = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
                print(myArray[1]) // Output: "banana"
            </code>
        </pre>
        <li><strong>Set:</strong> A set is an unordered collection of unique values of the same type. You can add
            and remove elements from a set using its methods, and you can iterate over the elements of a set using a
            for loop. Here's an example of how to create a set of integers and access its elements:</li>
        <pre>
                    <code>
                        var mySet = Set([1, 2, 3])
                        mySet.insert(4)
                        print(mySet.contains(3)) // Output: true
                    </code>
                </pre>
        <li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. You can add, remove, and
            access elements in a dictionary using subscript syntax, and you can iterate over the elements of a
            dictionary using a for loop. Here's an example of how to create a dictionary of strings and integers and
            access its elements:
        </li>
        <pre>
            <code>
                        var myDictionary = ["Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 35]
                        print(myDictionary["Bob"]) // Output: 30
                    </code>
                </pre>
        <li><strong>Tuples:</strong>In Swift, a tuple is a lightweight data structure that allows you to group multiple
            values into a single compound value. Tuples are useful for temporary groupings of related values,
            especially when the type of each value is different from the others.
        </li>
        <p>You can define a tuple by enclosing the values in parentheses and separating them with commas. Each
            element of a tuple can have a different type. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
                        <code>
                            let myTuple = (1, "Hello", true)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
        <p>You can access the individual elements of a tuple using dot notation and the index of the element. You
            can also name the individual elements of a tuple when you define it. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
                        <code>
                            let myNamedTuple = (id: 1, name: "John", age: 30)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
        <p>Tuples are often used to return multiple values from a function, or to pass multiple values as parameters
            to a function. They can be used in many different contexts to group and manipulate related values.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many ways you can use collection objects in Swift. Understanding how to
        use these collections and when to use them is an important part of iOS development, as many apps rely
        heavily on collections to store and manipulate data.</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Enums and Indirect Enums</strong>In Swift, an enumeration is a way to define a group of related values.
        Enumerations are useful when you need to work with a limited set of values, such as the days of the week, the
        months of the year, or the states of an application.
    </li>
    <p>Here's an example of how to define an enum:</p>
    <pre>
                <code>
                    enum CompassPoint {
                        case north
                        case south
                        case east
                        case west
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>This defines an enumeration called "CompassPoint" with four possible values: north, south, east, and west. You
        can use this enumeration to represent directions in your code:</p>
    <pre>
                <code>
                    let direction = CompassPoint.north
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>Indirect enums are a special type of enumeration that allows you to define recursive data structures. They are
        called "indirect" because they require the use of the "indirect" keyword before the enum definition. Here's an
        example:</p>
    <pre>
                <code>
                    indirect enum LinkedList<Element> {
                        case empty
                        case node(Element, LinkedList<Element>)
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>This defines an indirect enum called "LinkedList" that can be used to represent a linked list data structure. The
        "node" case contains an element of type "Element" and another linked list element.</p>
    <p>Enums and indirect enums are a powerful feature of Swift that can be used in many different contexts to define
        and work with groups of related values. They can be used to represent data structures, state machines, and more.
    </p>
    <li>
        <strong>Structs:</strong>
        In Swift, a struct is a user-defined data type that allows you to encapsulate related values and behaviors into
        a single unit. A struct can contain properties, methods, and initializers, and it can conform to protocols to
        provide additional functionality.
    </li>
    <p>Here's an example of how to define a simple struct:</p>
    <pre>
            <code>
                struct Person {
                    var name: String
                    var age: Int
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>This defines a struct called "Person" that contains two properties: "name" and "age". You can create an
        instance of this struct by using the initializer:</p>
    <pre>
            <code>
                let john = Person(name: "John Smith", age: 30)
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>You can access the properties of a struct using dot notation:</p>
    <pre>
            <code>
                print(john.name) // prints "John Smith"
                print(john.age) // prints "30"
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>Structs are a useful tool for organizing and managing related data in your code. They can be used in many
        different contexts, from simple data models to complex applications. Unlike classes, structs are value
        types, which means that they are copied when they are passed around in your code. This can be an advantage
        in some cases, as it avoids the possibility of unexpected side effects that can occur with reference types
        like classes.</p>
