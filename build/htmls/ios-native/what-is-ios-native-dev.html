    <h2>What is iOS Native development?</h2>
    <p>iOS Native development refers to the process of creating mobile applications specifically for Apple's iOS
        operating system, using the native development tools and frameworks provided by Apple.</p>
    <p>Native development involves writing code in Swift or Objective-C and using Apple's own frameworks such as UIKit,
        Core Data, and Core Animation to build apps that are optimized for iOS devices.</p>
    <p>Native apps have several advantages over web or hybrid apps, including better performance, more control over the
        user interface, and access to all of the device's hardware and features. For example, native apps can access the
        camera, accelerometer, and other sensors, while web apps cannot.</p>
    <p>Native apps can also take advantage of the latest features and capabilities of iOS, such as Apple Pay, Siri, and
        augmented reality.</p>
    <p>While native development can be more complex and time-consuming than other types of app development, it offers
        the most powerful and flexible approach to building iOS apps. </p>
