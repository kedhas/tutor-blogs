    <h2>Tools and software requirements</h2>
    <p>To develop iOS apps natively, you'll need a Mac computer and the following tools and software:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Xcode:</strong> Xcode is the integrated development environment (IDE) used to develop iOS apps. It
            includes a code editor, visual interface builder, and testing tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Swift or Objective-C:</strong> These are the programming languages used to write iOS apps. Swift is
            a newer language developed by Apple, while Objective-C has been used for many years.</li>
        <li><strong>iOS SDK:</strong> The iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) provides developers with a set of tools,
            frameworks, and APIs for building iOS apps. It includes everything from user interface elements to data
            storage and networking.</li>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and
            collaborate with others on your project. It's commonly used by developers to manage code and track changes
            over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, you may want to consider using third-party tools and frameworks to enhance your app development
        experience. For example, you could use CocoaPods, a dependency manager for iOS projects, or Fastlane, a set of
        tools for automating iOS app development tasks like building, testing, and deploying.</p>
