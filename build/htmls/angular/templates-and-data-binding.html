    <h2>Templates and Data Binding in Angular</h2>
    <p>
        Templates and data binding are two essential features of Angular that make it easy to create dynamic and
        interactive user interfaces. In this post, we'll discuss these concepts in more detail and provide examples of
        how they work in practice.
    </p>
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>
        In Angular, templates define the structure and layout of the user interface. Templates are typically written in
        HTML, but they also include additional syntax that allows for more advanced features like conditionals and
        loops. These advanced features are made possible by Angular's template syntax, which extends HTML with
        additional features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Structural directives like <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>*ngIf</code> allow developers to conditionally render
        elements or repeat elements based on data from the component class. For example, you can use <code>*ngFor</code>
        to render a list of items from an array in the component class.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li *ngFor="let item of items"&gt;{{ item }}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Data Binding</h3>
    <p>
        Data binding in Angular is the process of connecting data from the component class to the template. There are
        four types of data binding in Angular: interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interpolation:</strong> Interpolation is used to display data in the template using the double curly
            braces syntax (<code>{{ }}</code>). For example: <code>{{ name }}</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Property Binding:</strong> Property binding is used to set the value of an element's property based
            on data from the component class. This is done using square brackets (<code>[]</code>). For example:
            <code>&lt;img [src]="imageUrl"&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Binding:</strong> Event binding is used to bind a component class method to an event in the
            template. This is done using parentheses (<code>()</code>). For example:
            <code>&lt;button (click)="onClick()"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Way Binding:</strong> Two-way binding is used to bind a component class property to an element's
            value and to update the property when the element's value changes. This is done using the
            <code>[(ngModel)]</code> directive. For example: <code>&lt;input [(ngModel)]="name"&gt;</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Templates and data binding are essential concepts in Angular that allow developers to create dynamic and
        interactive web applications. By using templates and data binding, developers can create reusable and
        maintainable code that is easy to read and understand.
