    <p>State management is an important consideration in any Swift application, and there are many different tools and
        frameworks available to help you manage your application's state in a scalable and maintainable way. Here are
        some best practices to keep in mind when working with state in Swift:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Separate state management from business logic:</strong> It's important to keep your state management
            code separate from your business logic to make it easier to reason about the behavior of your application.
            You can achieve this by creating separate state management classes or using a dedicated state management
            framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Use immutable state:</strong> When possible, it's best to use immutable state to make your code more
            predictable and easier to reason about. By using immutable state, you can avoid unexpected side effects and
            ensure that changes to state are explicitly controlled.</li>

        <li><strong>Use declarative programming:</strong> Declarative programming can help you manage state more
            effectively by reducing the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write and making it easier to reason
            about the behavior of your application. You can achieve this by using a declarative state management
            framework or using functional programming techniques to manage state.</li>

        <li><strong>Avoid overcomplicating your state management:</strong> While it's important to have a structured and
            scalable approach to state management, it's also important to avoid overcomplicating your state management
            code. Keep your state management code as simple and straightforward as possible, and avoid unnecessary
            abstractions or complexity that can make it harder to understand and maintain your code.</li>

        <li><strong>Test your state management code:</strong> As with any other code in your application, it's important
            to test your state management code to ensure that it works as expected and to catch any bugs or issues early
            on in the development process. You can use unit tests or integration tests to test your state management
            code, depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these best practices, you can help ensure that your state management code is structured, scalable,
        and maintainable, and that it supports the needs of your application over time.</p>
