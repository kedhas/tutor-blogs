    <h2>Popular Modules</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js has a vast ecosystem of modules that can be used to add additional functionality to your applications.
        In this section, we will explore some of the most popular Node.js modules and how they can be used in your
        applications.
    </p>
    <h3>Express</h3>
    <p>
        Express is a fast, minimalist, and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of
        features for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications, as well as APIs. Express is widely
        used in production environments and has a large community of contributors and users. Some of the key features of
        Express include routing, middleware support, and easy integration with other popular Node.js modules.
    </p>
    <h3>Mongoose</h3>
    <p>
        Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a simple, yet powerful
        way to interact with MongoDB databases and is widely used in production environments. Mongoose allows developers
        to define schemas for their data, as well as providing support for validation, hooks, and middleware. It also
        provides a powerful query API for performing complex queries on MongoDB data.
    </p>
    <h3>Socket.IO</h3>
    <p>
        Socket.IO is a real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication library for Node.js. It provides a simple
        and easy-to-use API for building real-time applications such as chat rooms, gaming applications, and
        collaboration tools. Socket.IO uses WebSockets as its primary transport mechanism, but also provides fallback
        options for older browsers or environments where WebSockets are not available.

        These are just a few examples of the many popular Node.js modules available in the ecosystem. In the next
        section of this tutorial, we will explore how to use some of these modules in your applications. By the end of
        this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage popular Node.js modules to build powerful
        and flexible applications.
