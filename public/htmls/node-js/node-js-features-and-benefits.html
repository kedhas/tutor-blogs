    <h2>Features and Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js comes with a variety of features and benefits that make it an attractive option for building server-side
        web applications. Some of these include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast and efficient performance:</strong> Node.js is built on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine,
            which provides fast and efficient performance by compiling JavaScript code directly to machine code.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Node.js is designed to handle large amounts of data and can support thousands
            of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Event-driven, non-blocking I/O:</strong> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
            allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the event loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich ecosystem of modules and tools:</strong> Node.js has a vast library of modules and tools that
            make it easy to build and deploy complex applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> Node.js is a cross-platform technology that can run on
            Windows, macOS, and Linux, among other operating systems.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript on both client and server:</strong> Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both
            the client and server sides of an application, which streamlines development and makes it easier to share
            code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these features and benefits, Node.js is a popular choice for building modern web applications that require
        real-time communication, high scalability, and efficient performance. Whether you're building a small website or
        a large-scale enterprise application, Node.js can provide the tools and flexibility you need to get the job
        done.
