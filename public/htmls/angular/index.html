  <h1>Introduction to Angular</h1>
  <p>If you're interested in building dynamic and interactive web applications, you might want to consider using a
    front-end framework like Angular. Angular is a popular framework for building web applications with JavaScript and
    HTML, and it offers many features that make it a powerful tool for developers.</p>
  <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
  <p>Angular is a front-end web framework developed by Google. It allows you to build dynamic and interactive web
    applications by extending HTML with new tags and attributes, and by providing a powerful set of features for
    building complex applications.</p>
  <h2>Why use Angular?</h2>
  <p>Angular offers many benefits for developers, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modular and reusable code</li>
    <li>Powerful data binding and template syntax</li>
    <li>Dependency injection for managing application components</li>
    <li>Efficient change detection for improved performance</li>
    <li>Integrated testing tools</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Getting started with Angular</h2>
  <p>To get started with Angular, you'll need to have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll also need
    to have a basic understanding of web development concepts like the Document Object Model (DOM) and the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.</p>
  <p>The best way to get started with Angular is to follow the official documentation and tutorials. The Angular website
    provides a comprehensive set of guides and tutorials to help you get started with the framework. You can also find
    many third-party resources like blogs, videos, and courses to help you learn Angular.</p>
  <h1>Angular CLI</h1>
  <p>Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool for creating and managing Angular projects. It provides a set of
    commands that make it easy to set up, develop, and deploy Angular applications.</p>
  <h2>Key Features of Angular CLI</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Project scaffolding:</strong> Angular CLI can generate a new Angular project with a simple command.</li>
    <li><strong>Development server:</strong> Angular CLI provides a built-in development server that allows developers
      to build and test their applications locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Code generation:</strong> Angular CLI can generate new components, services, directives, and other
      Angular artifacts with a simple command.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Angular CLI comes with built-in support for testing, including generating test files
      and running tests.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Angular CLI provides a simple way to build an optimized version of an Angular
      application for deployment.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Using Angular CLI can save developers a lot of time and help ensure that their code follows best practices. It's
    also a great way to get started with Angular, as it sets up a lot of the boilerplate code that's required to build
    an Angular application.</p>
