    <h1>Introduction to HTML and its history</h1>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a coding language used for creating and structuring web
        pages. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML has been an integral
        part of the web since its inception, and it continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of the web.</p>
    <p>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It provided a
        basic structure for creating web pages, but it was limited in its capabilities. Over the years, HTML has been
        updated and improved to include new features and capabilities, with the most recent version being HTML5.</p>
    <p>HTML is a markup language, which means that it uses tags and attributes to describe the structure and content of
        a web page. The tags describe the type of content contained within them, and the attributes provide additional
        information about that content. For example, the `
    <p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, and the `style` attribute can be used to specify the font and color of that
        paragraph's text.</p>
    <p>HTML is an essential skill for any web developer, as it provides the foundation for creating web pages. Whether
        you're creating a personal blog, a company website, or a complex web application, understanding HTML is a must.
        With its constantly evolving capabilities, HTML will remain a critical component of the web for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, HTML is an important and fundamental part of the web, and understanding its history and
        capabilities is essential for anyone who wants to work in web development. With its constantly evolving features
        and capabilities, HTML provides a solid foundation for creating a wide range of web-based content and
        applications.</p>
