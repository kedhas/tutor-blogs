    <h1>HTML Elements: An Introduction</h1>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used for creating content for the web. It provides a way to
        structure and present information on a webpage. HTML consists of a set of elements, each with a specific
        function.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings are used to structure content on a page. There are six levels of headings, with H1 being the most
        important and H6 the least important. Headings should be used in order, with H1 at the top and H6 at the bottom.

    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs are used to group related content together. They are represented in HTML by the "p" tag. You can use
        the "br" tag to create line breaks within a paragraph.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>Lists are used to present information in a structured manner. There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered lists
        and unordered lists. Ordered lists are numbered, while unordered lists use bullets.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Links are used to connect one webpage to another. They are represented in HTML by the "a" tag. You can specify
        the destination of the link using the "href" attribute.</p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Images are used to add visual content to a webpage. They are represented in HTML by the "img" tag. You can
        specify the source of the image using the "src" attribute.</p>
    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p>Tables are used to display data in a structured format. They are represented in HTML by the "table" tag. You can
        add rows and columns using the "tr" and "td" tags, respectively.</p>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>Forms are used to collect data from users. They are represented in HTML by the "form" tag. You can add input
        fields using various types of "input" tags, such as text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes.</p>
    <p>These are some of the most commonly used HTML elements for creating content on the web. With these basic building
        blocks, you can create a wide range of webpages and applications.</p>
