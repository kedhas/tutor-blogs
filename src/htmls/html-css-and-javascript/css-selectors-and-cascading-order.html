    <h1>CSS Selectors and Cascading Order</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It enables web developers to separate the presentation of a document from its
        content. One of the fundamental concepts of CSS is the use of selectors to target HTML elements and apply
        styling rules to them.</p>

    <h2>Selectors</h2>
    <p>There are several types of selectors in CSS. The most basic type is the element selector, which targets elements
        based on their tag name. For example, to target all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements, you can use the following
        selector:</p>

    <pre><code>p {
        /* CSS styling rules go here */
    }</code></pre>

    <p>You can also target elements based on their class or ID attributes. Class selectors use a period (<code>.</code>)
        followed by the class name, while ID selectors use a hash symbol (<code>#</code>) followed by the ID name. For
        example:</p>

    <pre><code>.my-class {
        /* CSS styling rules go here */
    }
    
    #my-id {
        /* CSS styling rules go here */
    }</code></pre>

    <h2>Cascading Order</h2>
    <p>The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the process of determining which styles should be applied to an element
        when there are conflicting styles. There are several factors that determine the cascading order:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> This refers to the level of specificity of a selector. For example, an ID
            selector is more specific than a class selector, which is more specific than an element selector. If two
            selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the stylesheet takes precedence.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Some properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. If
            a property is not explicitly set on a child element, it inherits the value from its parent element. However,
            if the property is set on the child element, it takes precedence over the inherited value.</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Styles can be marked as important using the <code>!important</code> keyword.
            This gives them the highest precedence and overrides all other styles, even those with higher specificity or
            that are inherited.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding CSS selectors and the cascading order is crucial for creating well-designed and maintainable
        stylesheets. By using specific and targeted selectors, you can avoid conflicts and ensure that your styles are
        applied correctly.</p>
