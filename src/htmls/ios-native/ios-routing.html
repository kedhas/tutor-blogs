    <h1>Routing</h1>
    <p>Routing is the process of navigating between different screens or views in an iOS app. In Swift, there are
        several ways to handle routing, including using storyboards, programmatic routing, or a combination of both.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of how you might use programmatic routing in Swift:</p>
    <pre><code>// Create a new view controller
    let viewController = MyViewController()
  
    // Set up the navigation controller
    let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: viewController)
  
    // Present the navigation controller
    self.present(navigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we create a new view controller called "MyViewController". We then set up a navigation
        controller with "MyViewController" as the root view controller. Finally, we present the navigation controller to
        the user.</p>
    <p>Programmatic routing gives you more control over the navigation flow of your app and can be a good choice for
        more complex apps. However, for simpler apps, storyboards can be a quick and easy way to handle routing. </p>
    <p>Here's an example of how you might use storyboards to handle routing in Swift:</p>
    <pre><code>// Get a reference to the storyboard
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
  
    // Get a reference to the view controller you want to present
    let viewController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "MyViewController")
  
    // Present the view controller
    self.present(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we get a reference to the "Main" storyboard and then use it to instantiate a new view controller
        with the identifier "MyViewController". We then present the view controller to the user.</p>
    <p>Overall, Swift provides several options for handling routing in your iOS app, allowing you to choose the approach
        that works best for your app and your development style.</p>
