    <h1>@State</h1>
    <p>In SwiftUI, <code>@State</code> is a property wrapper that is used to declare a mutable state property. When a
        state property is changed, SwiftUI automatically updates the view to reflect the change.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the following code snippet:</p>
    <pre><code>struct ContentView: View {
      @State var count = 0
      
      var body: some View {
        VStack {
          Text("Count: \(count)")
          Button("Increment") {
            count += 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this code, <code>@State</code> is used to declare a mutable state property called <code>count</code>. The
        <code>count</code> variable is used to display the value of the counter in the text view, and is incremented
        when the user taps the button.</p>
    <p>When the <code>count</code> variable is modified, SwiftUI automatically updates the view to reflect the change.
        This allows for a more reactive and declarative approach to building UIs, as the developer does not need to
        manually update the view when the state changes.</p>
    <p><code>@State</code> is just one of the many property wrappers available in SwiftUI, and is used extensively to
        manage the state of the view.</p>
