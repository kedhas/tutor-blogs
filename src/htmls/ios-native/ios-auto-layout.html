    <p>Auto Layout is a powerful layout system that allows you to create user interfaces that can adapt to different
        screen sizes and device orientations. With Auto Layout, you describe the desired layout of your user interface
        using a set of constraints, and the system automatically adjusts the layout based on the available space.</p>
    <p>Auto Layout is used extensively in iOS development to create responsive, adaptable interfaces that work on a wide
        range of devices. Here's an overview of how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Constraints are rules that define the relationships between the elements of
            your user interface. For example, you might create a constraint that specifies that a button should always
            be 20 points from the top of the screen, or that two elements should be the same width. Constraints can be
            created in Interface Builder or in code.</li>
        <li><strong>Autoresizing:</strong> Autoresizing is a simple system that was used before Auto Layout to adjust
            the size and position of views when the screen size changed. It is still supported for backwards
            compatibility, but Auto Layout is now the preferred method for creating responsive interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Type:</strong> Dynamic Type is a feature that allows the system to adjust the size of text
            in your app based on the user's preferred font size. It works seamlessly with Auto Layout to ensure that
            your user interface looks great at any size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of how to create a simple layout using Auto Layout:</p>
    <pre><code>
        class MyViewController: UIViewController {
            let label = UILabel()
          override func viewDidLoad() {
          super.viewDidLoad()
          label.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        label.text = "Hello, World!"
        label.textAlignment = .center
        label.textColor = .black
        label.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 24)
        
        view.addSubview(label)
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
          label.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
          label.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)
        ])
        }
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we create a new view controller subclass called <code>MyViewController</code> that adds a
        <code>UILabel</code> to its view. We use the <code>translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints</code> property to
        disable the default autoresizing behavior of the label, and we set the text, alignment, color, and font
        properties. Finally, we create two constraints that center the label horizontally and vertically within the
        view, and we activate them using the <code>NSLayoutConstraint.activate</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>Auto Layout can take some time to learn, but it is an essential tool for creating responsive and adaptable user
        interfaces in iOS development. By understanding how to create and use constraints, you can create layouts that
        work on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.</p>
