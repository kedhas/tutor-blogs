    <p>While using the <code>@State</code> property wrapper is a common approach to managing state in a Swift
        application, there are also many third-party state management frameworks available that can help you build more
        complex and scalable applications.</p>
    <p>One popular state management framework in the Swift community is <code>ReactiveSwift</code>, which is based on
        the principles of reactive programming. ReactiveSwift provides a set of APIs for managing state as streams of
        values that can be transformed and combined using a set of functional operators.</p>
    <p>Another popular state management framework is <code>Combine</code>, which is Apple's own reactive programming
        framework. Combine provides a set of APIs for working with publishers and subscribers to manage state in a
        declarative and reactive way. Combine is integrated with SwiftUI, making it a natural choice for state
        management in SwiftUI-based applications.</p>
    <p>Other state management frameworks that are popular in the Swift community include <code>ReduxSwift</code>,
        <code>ReSwift</code>, and <code>RxSwift</code>. Each of these frameworks provides a unique set of features and
        APIs for managing state, and the choice of which framework to use depends on the specific needs of your
        application.</p>
    <p>Using a state management framework can help you build more scalable and maintainable applications by providing a
        structured way to manage the state of your application. By using a framework that is specifically designed for
        state management, you can reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write and make it easier to
        reason about the behavior of your application.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of how you might use the <code>Combine</code> framework to manage the state of a simple counter
        application:</p>
    <pre><code>
  import SwiftUI
  import Combine
  
  class CounterViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0
    private var cancellable: AnyCancellable?
    
    init() {
      cancellable = $count
        .sink { count in
          print("Current count is \(count)")
        }
    }
    
    func increment() {
      count += 1
    }
    
    func decrement() {
      count -= 1
    }
  }
  
  struct CounterView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = CounterViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        Text("Count: \(viewModel.count)")
        HStack {
          Button("Increment") {
            viewModel.increment()
          }
          Button("Decrement") {
            viewModel.decrement()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we define a <code>CounterViewModel</code> class that is responsible for managing the state of
        the counter. The <code>CounterViewModel</code> class uses the <code>@Published</code> property wrapper to
        publish changes to the <code>count</code> property, and it uses the <code>sink</code> operator to subscribe to
        changes in the <code>count</code> property and print out the current value.</p>
    <p>The <code>CounterView</code> struct is responsible for rendering the user interface of the counter. The
        <code>CounterView</code> struct observes changes to the <code>CounterViewModel</code> using the
        <code>@ObservedObject</code> property wrapper, and it provides buttons to increment and decrement the count.</p>
    <p>This is just a simple example of how you might use the <code>Combine</code> framework to manage the state of a
        simple counter application. In a real-world application, you would likely have a more complex state management
        system that involves multiple views and interactions with an API or other external data source.</p>

    <p>Overall, state management is an important consideration in any Swift application, and there are many different
        tools and frameworks available to help you manage your application's state in a scalable and maintainable way.
