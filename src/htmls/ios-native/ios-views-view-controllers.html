    <h1>Views and View Controllers</h1>
    <p>In iOS development, views and view controllers are the building blocks of the user interface. Views are the
        visual elements that appear on the screen, such as buttons, labels, or images, while View Controllers manage one
        or more views and their interactions with the user.</p>
    <h2>Creating Views</h2>
    <p>In UIKit, views are typically created programmatically or using Interface Builder, a graphical tool that allows
        you to design your user interface visually. Here's an example of creating a label programmatically:</p>
    <pre><code>let label = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 21))
  label.center = CGPoint(x: 160, y: 284)
  label.textAlignment = .center
  label.text = "Hello, World!"
  self.view.addSubview(label)</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we create a new UILabel and add it to the current view. The label is positioned at the center of
        the screen and displays the text "Hello, World!".</p>
    <p>In SwiftUI, views are created using a declarative syntax, making it easy to create complex interfaces with just a
        few lines of code. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        Text("Hello, World!")
          .font(.headline)
        Button("Tap me!") {
          print("Button tapped")
        }
      }
    }
  }</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we create a new SwiftUI View called ContentView and add a Text view and a Button view to a
        VStack. The Button has a closure that prints a message to the console when tapped.</p>
    <h2>Creating View Controllers</h2>
    <p>View Controllers manage one or more views and their interactions with the user. In UIKit, you can create a new
        View Controller by subclassing UIViewController and implementing its methods. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      let label = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 21))
      label.center = CGPoint(x: 160, y: 284)
      label.textAlignment = .center
      label.text = "Hello, World!"
      self.view.addSubview(label)
    }
  }</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we create a new View Controller called MyViewController and add a new UILabel to its view. The
        label is positioned at the center of the screen and displays the text "Hello, World!".</p>
    <p>In SwiftUI, you can create a new View by defining a new struct that conforms to the View protocol. Here's an
        example:</p>
    <pre><code>struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        Text("Hello, World!")
          .font(.headline)
        Button("Tap me!") {
          print("Button tapped")
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
      ContentView()
    }
  }</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we create a new View called ContentView and a Preview Provider that allows us to see how the
        View looks in different contexts, such as light or dark mode.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Views and View Controllers are the basic building blocks of any
    <div>
        <p>In iOS development, Views and View Controllers are the fundamental elements of the user interface. Views are
            the visual elements that appear on the screen, such as buttons, labels, or images, while View Controllers
            manage one or more views and their interactions with the user.</p>
