    <h2>Control flow and functions</h2>
    <p>Control flow statements in Swift allow you to make decisions and repeat code based on certain conditions. Here
        are some of the basic control flow statements in Swift:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If statement:</strong> Executes a block of code if a certain condition is true.</li>
        <li><strong>For loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code a certain number of times.</li>
        <li><strong>While loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch statement:</strong> Executes different blocks of code based on the value of a certain
            variable or expression.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of an if statement in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let number = 42
            if number > 0 {
                print("The number is positive")
            } else if number < 0 {
                print("The number is negative")
            } else {
                print("The number is zero")
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Functions in Swift are reusable blocks of code that can be called from other parts of your program. Here's an
        example of a simple function in Swift:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            func sayHello() {
                print("Hello, world!")
            }

            // Call the function
            sayHello()
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Functions can also take parameters and return values. Here's an example of a function that takes two parameters
        and returns their sum:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            func addNumbers(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
                return a + b
            }

            // Call the function
            let sum = addNumbers(3, 4)
            print("The sum is \(sum)")
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Swift also supports closures, which are anonymous functions that can be passed around and used in your code.
        Here's an example of a closure that adds two numbers:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let addClosure = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Int in
                return a + b
            }

            // Call the closure
            let result = addClosure(3, 4)
            print("The result is \(result)")
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Closures and functions are similar in that they are both blocks of code that can be called from other parts of a
        program. However, there are some important differences between the two:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Closures have a more compact syntax than functions. A closure is defined using
            braces {} instead of the func keyword, and its parameters and return type are defined using an arrow ->.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capturing values:</strong> Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables
            from the surrounding context in which they are defined. This means that they can access and modify those
            values even if they are defined outside the closure's scope. Functions, on the other hand, can only access
            and modify values that are passed to them as parameters or are defined within their own scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Passing around:</strong> Closures can be passed around and used as arguments to other functions,
            just like any other variable. This makes them a powerful tool for functional programming and for
            implementing features like callbacks and completion handlers. Functions can also be passed around as
            arguments, but they must be defined and named before they can be passed.</li>
    </ol>
