    <h1>CSS Properties: Color, Font, Text, and Box</h1>

    <p>When it comes to styling web pages, CSS offers a variety of properties to modify the look and feel of HTML
        elements. In this post, we will explore some of the most common CSS properties for color, font, text, and box
        styling.</p>

    <h2>Color Properties</h2>

    <p>CSS provides several properties to modify the color of elements. One of the most common is the <code>color</code>
        property, which sets the text color. For example, <code>color: red;</code> would make the text appear in red.
        Other properties include <code>background-color</code> to set the background color of an element and
        <code>border-color</code> to set the color of an element's border.</p>

    <h2>Font Properties</h2>

    <p>Font properties are used to modify the text style of an element. <code>font-family</code> sets the font used for
        the text, while <code>font-size</code> sets the size of the font. Other properties include
        <code>font-style</code> to set the style of the font (e.g. italic), <code>font-weight</code> to set the weight
        of the font (e.g. bold), and <code>text-transform</code> to modify the case of the text (e.g. uppercase).</p>

    <h2>Text Properties</h2>

    <p>CSS provides several properties to modify the text appearance, such as <code>text-align</code> to set the
        alignment of the text within its container, and <code>text-decoration</code> to add an underline or
        strike-through to the text. Other properties include <code>line-height</code> to set the spacing between lines
        of text, and <code>letter-spacing</code> to adjust the space between letters.</p>

    <h2>Box Properties</h2>

    <p>Box properties are used to modify the layout and appearance of HTML elements. <code>width</code> and
        <code>height</code> set the dimensions of an element, while <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> set the
        spacing around an element. <code>border</code> sets the border around an element, with properties to set the
        width, style, and color of the border.</p>

    <p>These are just a few of the CSS properties available for modifying the appearance of HTML elements. Understanding
        these properties is essential for creating visually appealing and functional web pages.</p>
