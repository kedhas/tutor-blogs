    <h2>Directives</h2>
    <p>Directives are a way to extend the HTML syntax with custom behaviors. They are markers on a DOM element that tell
        Angular to do something with that element. There are three types of directives in Angular: component directives,
        attribute directives, and structural directives.</p>
    <h3>Component Directives</h3>
    <p>Component directives are the most common type of directive. They are used to create reusable UI components that
        can be used throughout an application. Components are essentially a group of HTML elements, styles, and behavior
        that can be used to build a specific part of a UI.</p>
    <h3>Attribute Directives</h3>
    <p>Attribute directives are used to change the behavior or appearance of an element. They can be used to add or
        remove CSS classes, change the style of an element, or add behavior to an element. Attribute directives are used
        by adding an attribute to an element, followed by the directive name.</p>
    <h3>Structural Directives</h3>
    <p>Structural directives are used to add or remove elements from the DOM based on a condition. They can be used to
        create loops or conditionals in the template. Structural directives are used by adding an asterisk (*) to the
        directive name.</p>
    <h2>Pipes</h2>
    <p>Pipes are a way to transform data in an Angular template. They take data as input and transform it into a desired
        output. There are many built-in pipes in Angular, and developers can also create their own custom pipes.</p>
    <h3>Built-in Pipes</h3>
    <p>Angular provides a set of built-in pipes that can be used to transform data in the template. Some examples of
        built-in pipes include the *uppercase* pipe, which transforms text to all uppercase, and the *date* pipe, which
        formats dates.</p>
    <h3>Custom Pipes</h3>
    <p>Developers can also create their own custom pipes to transform data in a specific way. Custom pipes can be
        created using the *@Pipe* decorator, which tells Angular that the class is a pipe. Custom pipes can be used in
        the template just like built-in pipes.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's an example of using a directive and a pipe in an Angular template. In this example, we have a list of
        items that we want to display in a dropdown. We also want to show the current date and time in the template.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;select appCustomDirective&gt;
      &lt;option *ngFor="let item of items"&gt;{{ item }}&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current date and time is {{ currentDate | date }}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we're using the *ngFor* directive to loop through the *items* array and display each item as an
        option in a select element. We're also using the *date* pipe to format the *currentDate* property as a date.</p>
