    <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to create
        server-side applications using JavaScript. It is built on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine, which provides
        fast and efficient performance. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it ideal for
        building scalable and responsive applications that can handle large amounts of data and real-time interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike traditional server-side languages such as PHP or Ruby, Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop that
        allows it to handle multiple concurrent requests with minimal overhead. This makes Node.js a great choice for
        building modern web applications that require fast, real-time communication between the server and the client.
        Node.js also comes with a rich ecosystem of modules and tools that make it easy to build and deploy complex
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js has grown into a mature and widely adopted technology. Its
        popularity has been driven by its simplicity, speed, and versatility. With Node.js, developers can use the same
        language on both the client and server sides of an application, which streamlines development and makes it
        easier to share code. Whether you're building a simple API or a complex web application, Node.js is a powerful
        and flexible tool that can help you get the job done.
